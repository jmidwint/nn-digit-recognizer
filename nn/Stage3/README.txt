Code for Stage3 - Exploration of Deep Learning Techniques 
 - this stage was for exploring convolutional network for
solving the MNIST digit recognition problem.

- the model code from Tensor flow was used and modified to 
work with the Kaggle data as well as the straight MNIST data.

- to see what sort of quick results could be obtained. 

- convolutional.py contains that code from TensorFlow example, 
 that I then modified and was temporarily
in parent directory to this one, to be able to run due to its dependencies
on other code that I had written. That was a klugy solution to not
properly solving the dependency issue.
